# Drupal Bootstrap LESS Starterkit customisation for CLARIN theme
The contents of this directory act as an 'overlay' that customises the 
[Drupal Bootstrap](https://drupal-bootstrap.org) sub-theme for CLARIN by adapting and
extending the [LESS starterkit](https://drupal-bootstrap.org/api/bootstrap/starterkits%21less%21README.md/7).

A distribution of the CLARIN base style (which is a bootstrap customisation) is **not** 
included here. Instead, it should be compiled from a base style distribution that can be 
obtained from that project's [releases](https://github.com/clarin-eric/base_style/releases). 

The build script in this project follows a procedure according to the above principles.
